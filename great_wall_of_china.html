                The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications that were built across the historical northern borders of ancient
                Chinese states and Imperial China as protection against various nomadic groups from the Eurasian Steppe. Several walls
                were built from as early as the 7th century BC, with selective stretches later joined together by Qin Shi Huang
                (220–206 BC), the first emperor of China. Little of the Qin wall remains. Later on, many successive dynasties built and
                maintained multiple stretches of border walls. The most well-known sections of the wall were built by the Ming dynasty
                (1368–1644).

                <br> <br>

                Apart from defense, other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties
                on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and
                emigration. Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of
                watchtowers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact
                that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.
